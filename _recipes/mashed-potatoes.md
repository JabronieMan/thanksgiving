### Ingredients

*   3 1/4 pounds yukon gold potatoes (smaller preferred)
*   1 pound unsalted butter
*   1/4 cup hot milk
*   salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

1.  Peel the **Yukon Gold potatoes** and cut them into roughly equal-sized 1 1/2 to 2-inch chunks. If using a ricer later, you can skip peeling. If the potatoes are small enough you can leave them whole.
2.  Place the cut potatoes in a large pot and cover them with cold, salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain a simmer. Cook until the potatoes are completely tender and easily pierced with a fork (about 15-20 minutes).
3.  Drain the potatoes thoroughly in a colander. Allow them to sit for 1-2 minutes to steam-dry.
4.  In a small saucepan, warm the **1/4 cup of hot milk** together.
5.  Return the potatoes to the empty pot. Mash them vigorously with a potato masher or use a potato ricer for the smoothest results.
6.  add the hot milk mixture while continuing to mash until the desired smooth and creamy consistency is achieved. Incorporate the butter from cold to ensure the emulsion is maintained, but don’t go too slow or you’ll risk overworking the potatoes.
7.  Season generously with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
