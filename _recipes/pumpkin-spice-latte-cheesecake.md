**serves 8 | active time: 45 minutes | total time: at least 6 hours**

### Ingredients

***for the crust:***

*   180 grams (12 sheets) graham crackers
*   ½ teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt
*   84 grams (6 tablespoons) unsalted melted butter, plus more for pan
*   56 grams (3 tablespoons) pure maple syrup

***for the cheesecake:***

*   240 grams (1 cup) roasted winter squash (or pumpkin puree)
*   454 grams (2-8 ounce packages) cream cheese, room temperature
*   107 grams (½ cup packed) light or dark brown sugar
*   75 grams (¼ cup) pure maple syrup
*   1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
*   2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
*   1 ½ teaspoons ground ginger
*   ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
*   ¼ teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt
*   113 grams (½ cup) heavy cream, room temperature
*   3 large eggs, well beaten, room temperature

***for the caramel (optional):***

*   67 grams (⅓ cup) granulated sugar
*   40 grams (2 tablespoons) corn syrup
*   30 grams (2 tablespoons) water
*   113 grams (½ cup) heavy cream
*   1 tablespoon espresso powder

### Instructions

1.  Set oven rack in lower-middle position; preheat to 325F. Brush a 9-inch springform pan evenly with melted butter.
2.  In a food processor, combine the graham crackers and salt and process until finely ground. Drizzle in the melted butter and maple and pulse to combine. It will look oily, that’s okay.
3.  Dump the graham mixture into the prepared pan and use your fingers and the bottom of a measuring cup to press it evenly along the bottom.
4.  Place in the oven to bake until browned and dry, 16 to 20 minutes. (It will be soft out of the oven, then crisp as it cools.) Cool completely, at least 30 minutes. (Tightly wrapped, the crust will keep at room temperature for 1 week or in the freezer for 1 month.)
5.  In a food processor, puree the squash until smooth. Take your time, stopping to scrape the sides of the processor and under the blade, ensuring there are no chunks. (If using pumpkin puree, skip to the next step.)
6.  Add the cream cheese, brown sugar, maple, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt. Process until evenly combined, stopping to scrape the sides of the processor and under the blade. Add the cream and beaten eggs, and process until evenly combined. (Do not overmix after adding the eggs and cream.)
7.  Pour into the baked and cooled crust. (If you want to level it up, pass it through a fine mesh strainer before pouring it into the crust.) Bake at 325F until the edges are set, but the center is still very runny, 35 to 40 minutes. (An instant-read thermometer inserted 1-inch from the edge should register between 170 to 175F). Turn off the oven and prop open the door with a wooden spoon. Continue cooking cheesecake in off oven for 1 hour. Cool fully in the fridge, at least 3 hours and preferably overnight, before serving. (Store tightly wrapped in the fridge for 5 days or freezer for 1 month.)
8.  (Optional Caramel) Combine the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a small pot. Cook over medium heat, swirling occasionally, until deeply browned, about 10 to 12 minutes. Carefully add the cream and espresso powder (it will bubble and steam vigorously) and simmer until thick and combined, about 1 minutes. Cool slightly then pour over cheesecake or serve alongside slices. (Keeps in the fridge forever.)
