### Ingredients

*   2 14-ounce cans coconut cream* or full-fat coconut milk (see notes for brand recommendations)
*   1/2 cup organic cane sugar (sub up to half with agave nectar or maple syrup)
*   1 pinch sea salt
*   1 vanilla bean pod (split and scraped // or 1/4 - 1/2 tsp vanilla powder per 1 pod)
*   2 tsp pure vanilla extract

### Instructions

1.  The day or night before, place your ice cream churning bowl in the freezer to properly chill (see notes if you don't have an ice cream maker).
2.  The following day, add coconut milk, organic cane sugar (sub up to half with natural sweetener), sea salt, scraped vanilla bean and vanilla extract to a high-speed blender and blend on high until completely creamy and smooth for 1-2 minutes to fully dissolve the sugar. Add more cane sugar or agave if it needs more sweetness, or more vanilla if it needs more vanilla flavor.
3.  Add mixture directly to chilled ice cream maker and churn according to manufacturer's instructions - about 45 minutes. It should look like soft serve (see photo). See notes if you don't have a churner.
4.  Once churned, transfer the ice cream to a large freezer-safe container (such as a loaf pan) and use a spoon to smooth the top.
5.  Cover securely and freeze for at least 4-6 hours or until firm. Set out for 5-10 minutes before serving to soften - a hot ice cream scoop also eases scooping.
6.  Will keep in the freezer for up to 10 days, though best when fresh. Pairs perfectly with pies, cakes, cookies and more!
