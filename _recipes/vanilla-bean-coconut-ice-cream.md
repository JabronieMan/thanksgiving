### Ingredients

*   two 400 ml tins full fat coconut milk
*   320 g tin condensed coconut milk
*   250 ml carton coconut cream
*   pinch salt
*   1 vanilla bean pod (split and scraped) 
*   2 tsp pure vanilla extract
*   a pinch grated nutmeg (optional)

### Instructions

1.  The day or night before, place your ice cream churning bowl in the freezer to properly chill (see notes if you don't have an ice cream maker).
2.  The following day, add all ingredients to a high-speed blender and blend on high until completely creamy and smooth for 1-2 minutes.
3.  Add mixture directly to chilled ice cream maker and churn according to manufacturer's instructions - about 45 minutes. It should look like soft serve (see photo). See notes if you don't have a churner.
4.  Once churned, transfer the ice cream to a large freezer-safe container (such as a loaf pan) and use a spoon to smooth the top.
5.  Cover securely and freeze for at least 4-6 hours or until firm. Set out for 5-10 minutes before serving to soften - a hot ice cream scoop also eases scooping.
6.  Will keep in the freezer for up to 10 days, though best when fresh. Pairs perfectly with pies, cakes, cookies and more!
