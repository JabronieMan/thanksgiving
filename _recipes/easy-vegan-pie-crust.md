### Ingredients

*   3 cup all-purpose flour (plus more for rolling)
*   0.5 teaspoon salt
*   0.5 teaspoon sugar
*   0.5 pound vegetable shortening
*   0.5 cup plant-based milk (or more if needed)

### Instructions

#### To make the dough:
1.  Add the flour, salt and sugar into a large bowl and whisk to combine. Cut the vegetable shortening into cubes and scatter into the flour. Use a fork or pastry cutter to slice the vegetable shortening into the flour until you reach a crumbly texture.
2.  Drizzle the milk across the flour mixture and use the fork to combine. Mix until everything comes together and you will be able to form a ball of dough. Don't over-mix.

#### To roll the dough:
1.  Spread a clean tea towel over your work surface and lightly sprinkle flour over it. Scoop the dough into a rough ball, and put it in the center of the floured tea towel. Roll it out until you have a rough circle that is several inches bigger than your pie dish to allow room for the sides and edges of the crust.

#### To form the pie crust:
1.  Use the tea towel to help you flip the dough into the pie dish. If some pieces fall off that's fine. Use a knife to cut off the excess pastry around the edges. If there are any holes, fill them with some of the extra pieces. Pinch the edges to form a pretty crust.

#### To Pre-Cook Your Pie Crust (optional):
1.  Only do this if the recipe requires a cooked crust prior to filling it. Preheat your oven to 450F (230C). Pierce the crust all over with a fork. Bake the crust for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 400F and continue cooking until the crust is lightly browned, just a couple more minutes.
