### Instructions

1.  Make sure that the bowl of your ice cream maker has been in the freezer for long enough, mine takes 11 hours to fully freeze.
2.  Add all of the ingredients to a blender and blitz until really smooth. Make sure that there are no grainy lumps of fat left.
3.  Pour into a bowl, cover and chill in the fridge overnight or for at least 4 hours.
