## Ingredients

*   one tube of sausage (always Jones pork sausage roll)
*   one loaf of Pepperidge Farm white
*   onions
*   celery
*   butter
*   mushrooms (sliced buttons, duh)
*   canned mandarin oranges
*   eggs
*   salt
*   pepper
*   poultry seasoning

## Instructions

1.  Sweat onions and celery in butter, set aside.
2.  Sauté mushrooms (sliced buttons, duh), set aside.
3.  Break up and brown sausage in a pan (like you would loose chorizo for egg), set aside and reserve grease.
4.  Melt some butter.
5.  Drain some canned mandarin oranges and break up the wedges.
6.  Tear the bread into pieces in a big bowl.
7.  Locate eggs, salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning.
8.  Toss in all the solid ingredients with the bread. Add some eggs, the sausage grease, some butter, salt, pepper, and, most importantly, poultry seasoning. Mix it all up. It will be too dry. Add some combo of more egg and butter and, I'm guessing, more poultry seasoning and salt.
9.  I usually immersion-circulate this first, then remove the backbone and rib cage of our turkey and cook the bird over the hot stuffing plug. Do what you want, though. If you're going to cook it without meat, you might want a bit of stock or something.
