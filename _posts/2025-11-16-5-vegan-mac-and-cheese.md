title:  "Vegan Macaroni and Cheese"

## Ingredients

*   1 pound elbow macaroni or piccolini
*   1/4 cup vegan margarine
*   1/3 cup all-purpose flour (or gluten-free all-purpose flour)
*   3 cups soy, almond, or rice milk
*   1/2 cup nutritional yeast
*   2 tablespoons tomato paste
*   2 teaspoons sea salt
*   1 teaspoon garlic powder
*   1 tablespoon lemon juice
*   1 tablespoon agave
*   2 tablespoons seasoned bread crumbs

## Procedure

1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease a 9 x 13 inch pan.
2.  Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook according to package directions. Drain and return to pot.
3.  Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, make a roux or paste by whisking the margarine and flour over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes. Add nondairy milk, yeast, tomato paste, salt, and garlic powder to the saucepan and bring to a boil, whisking frequently. Reduce heat to low and let simmer until the sauce thickens. Adjust seasoning to taste (I added a little black pepper) and stir in lemon juice and agave. Toss the noodles with the sauce and transfer to the prepared pan.
4.  Sprinkle bread crumbs on top of the pasta and bake for 30 minutes or until the top is lightly browned and crisp. Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
