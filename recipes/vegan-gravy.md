# Easy Vegan Gravy

### Ingredients

*   2 cups vegetable broth
*   3/4 teaspoon onion powder
*   3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
*   1 tablespoon soy sauce (or use tamari for gluten free)
*   1/2 teaspoon dijon mustard
*   1/4 cup all purpose flour (or use brown rice flour for gluten free)

### Instructions

1.  Add all ingredients to a medium sized pot and bring to a boil.
2.  Whisk over medium-high heat for a couple of minutes, until the gravy thickens.
3.  Serve with mashed potatoes! This gravy keeps well for up to a week in the fridge. Just re-warm, add a little water if too thick, stir and serve.
