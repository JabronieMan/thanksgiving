# Whole-Roasted Turkey

## Ingredients

*   10 to 14-pound turkey
*   Sage
*   Thyme
*   1 onion, quartered
*   1 head garlic, cloves smashed
*   Softened butter
*   3 tablespoons melted butter
*   3 tablespoons molasses (or honey or maple)
*   Water (for sheet tray)

## Procedure

### Low and Slow Cooking

1.  Start with a 10 to 14-pound turkey. (Bigger birds will cook unevenly and dry out using this method.)
2.  Dry brine for 24 to 48 hours.
3.  Set a wire rack onto a sheet tray.
4.  Use sage and thyme to make a bed of herbs for the turkey to rest on.
5.  Place the turkey onto the herbs, stuff the cavity with a quartered onion and the smashed cloves from a head of garlic.
6.  Secure the legs with the tail, twine, or foil.
7.  Smear the entire turkey with a thin layer of softened butter and top generously with more sprigs of thyme and sage.
8.  Pour enough water to cover the sheet tray by 1/4-inch and insert a digital thermometer into the thickest part of the turkey.
9.  Use a few long sheets of foil to cover the tray and turkey. Crimp tightly around the edges of the sheet tray, while molding the foil into a tent over the turkey, so it's not lying directly on the surface of the turkey.
10. Roast at 300F until you reach an internal temperature of 160F (an 11-pound turkey took 4 hours). You can leave the turkey at room temperature for up to 2 hours before it needs to be refrigerated.

### Glazing and Browning

1.  **Prepare for glazing based on turkey's current state:**
    *   If your turkey has been at room temperature for 2 hours, heat it covered at 350F for 10 minutes before proceeding.
    *   If your turkey has been in the refrigerator, let it sit out at room temperature for 1 hour, then heat it covered at 350F until you reach an internal temperature of 140F, about 45 minutes, before proceeding.
    *   If your turkey has just been roasted, remove it from the oven before proceeding.
2.  Increase oven temperature to 425F.
3.  Stir together 3 tablespoons melted butter with 3 tablespoons molasses (or honey or maple).
4.  Unwrap turkey, remove sprigs of herbs, and brush with a thin layer of molasses mixture.
5.  Roast turkey until deeply browned, about 8 to 10 minutes.
6.  Rest, uncovered, for 30 minutes, carve, and serve.
